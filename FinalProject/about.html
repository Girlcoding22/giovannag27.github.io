        <h1> What is E.Coli?</h1>
          <p3> E.Coli was discovered in the year 1885 by Theodor Escherich. E.Coli is usually passed on by contaminated water or food. It is known as the most studied bacteria. It is important to know that only a certain type of E.Coli is actually harmful to us. One example of bad E.Coli is the 0157:H7 this is more related to food poisoning, not many people knew about it until the year 1987. This specific part of E.Coli (0157:H7) has made a recent comeback here in California. </p3>

             <p> The map on the left shows the number of people that were infected with E.Coli during the recent outbreak with romaine lettuce throughout the United States (2018). California and Pennsylvania are colored in dark blue, meaning that they have the highest rates of people getting infected with thirteen to forty people getting sick in this recent outbreak. The second to darkest blue is shown in Idaho, Arizona, Minnesota, Montana and New York with nine to twelve people getting sick. The lightest blue in the chart (Ohio, Michigan, and Georgia) holds third place with five to eight people getting sick. The last two colors hold the least amount of people with this disease with only one to four people getting sick  </p>
