            <p2> Hello my name is ________ I am working with three other girls and in our design thinking class we came up with a question
                in hopes that the answer will help our community. 
                The question was “How might we work with scientist to treat contaminated food to stop people from suffering 
                from E.Coli in California?”.
                Recently we have been seeing the E.Coli disease take a toll in California. 
                We believe that this is something important to know because not only will
                it reduce the amount of people who have E.Coli but it might change how we take care of ourselves and our food. </p2>
